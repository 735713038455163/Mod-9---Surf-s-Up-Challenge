# Mod 9 - Surf's Up Challenge
 
## Overview of Project

During the ninth week of the Trilogy University of Toronto Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our Module 8 challenge is to create a written analysis with three key deliverables as follows; 

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of 4 deliverables:

-	Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
-	Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
-	Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

The tools we will be using are an online tool are  Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLLite, SQLALchemy to filter, and Flask, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code while posting to GitHub repository for the team to review work if required.


Specifically, the Business Owner W. Avy, wants us to analysis the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results

The key differences in weather between June and December are as follows;

-1. The temperature is in farenheight, and it is only slightly colder in December than in June.

-2. The stadard devaition suggest there is more fluxuation in December than in June but overall there is not by much variation. 

-3. The max temperature is 83 in December and 85, however the mean is 71 for December, and 75 in June.   

Overall opening in either June or December temperature wise there is not much of a significant difference. 

## Summary

There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.

The two recommendations for further analysis are as follows;

1-The temperature alone is not a good indication to conclude if there is going to be persipitation. Perhaps looking into the percipitation rates in addition to the temperature would be more beneficial data to help decide.

After, further review it appears that 95% of the data on percipitation indicates "Light rainfall." Light rainfall is considered less than 0.10 inches of rain per hour. Moderate rainfall measures 0.10 to 0.30 inches of rain per hour. Heavy rainfall is more than 0.30 inches of rain per hour.Therfore, there is only a 25% of moderate rainfall. 

2-Sorting all the persipitation data over the years in a scatter graph to determine the best month open the business is more valuable than just looking at two months to decide.
